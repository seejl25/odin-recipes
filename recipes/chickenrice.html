    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken rice is a beloved dish known for its simple yet flavorful 
        combination of tender chicken and fragrant rice. Popular in many 
        Asian cuisines, especially in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, 
        the dish often features poached or roasted chicken served over 
        rice cooked in chicken broth, garlic, and ginger. It is typically 
        accompanied by a tangy chili sauce, soy sauce, and sometimes a 
        ginger-scallion dip, creating a perfect harmony of taste. 
        Chicken rice is not just a meal; it's a cultural icon celebrated 
        for its comforting and wholesome appeal.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken</li>
        <li>rice</li>
        <li>ginger</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>sesame oil</li>
        <li>coriander</li>
        <li>cucumber</li>
        <li>shallots</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>chicken stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub chicken skin with salt and set aside</li>
        <li>In a pan or pot with a lid, heat up the chicken fat or oil. 
            Add the ginger, garlic, and shallot. Cook, stirring, until 
            fragrant. Stir in the rice and fry gently until glossy.</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock, then place the chicken, skin side up, in the 
            pan. Add the green onions on top. Bring to boil over medium high 
            heat and when it starts to simmer, cover and turn the heat down 
            to low. Cook for 17 minutes, turn off the heat, and let rest for 
            10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, make the green onion oil: place the 
            green onions in a deep heat proof bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small pot, heat 1/4 cup oil over medium heat until it 
            reaches 275Â°F. Remove the pot from the stove and very carefully 
            pour over the green onions - they will sizzle and bubble up. 
            Stir in salt to taste.</li>
        <li>When the 10 minute rest is up, remove and discard the green 
            onions. Remove the chicken and slice. Fluff up the rice and 
            serve with thinly sliced cucumbers and green onion oil. 
            Enjoy immediately!</li>
