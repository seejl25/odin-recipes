Mockup idea for the webpage before delving into developing the webpage

About the webpage
- Project requirement was focused on learning to link different html files (recipes) together with no styling requirements
- I decided to challenge myself by attempting to style into a homepage
- Flexbox was used instead of grid for this webpage
- Contains the hero section to attract users, followed by recipes section, and lastly a contact page
- Attempted to make a "Contact Us" form
